## 🚀 About Me

I’m an AI & Full-Stack Engineer who loves building **smart, scalable, and meaningful tech**. From fine-tuning LLMs to deploying multi-agent AI workflows in the cloud, I thrive at the intersection of cutting-edge innovation and real-world problem-solving.

Whether I’m designing RAG pipelines for enterprise automation, crafting fast web interfaces with React & FastAPI, or optimizing ETL workflows in Databricks—my goal is simple: **build elegant systems that deliver impact.**

🛠️ Currently working on: 
- Building RAG applications with LangChain + vector DBs
- Serverless GenAI apps on AWS Bedrock
- AI agents that collaborate (yes, for real) using CrewAI

## 🧠 What I Do

- 🧩 **Generative AI Engineering** – Prompt crafting, fine-tuning LLMs, embeddings, vector search (FAISS, Pinecone), LangChain magic
- ⚙️ **Cloud-Native Development** – AWS, Azure, serverless infra, Docker/K8s, microservices, DevOps pipelines
- 🔄 **ETL & Data Engineering** – PySpark, Airflow, MLOps, Unity Catalog, Databricks
- 🌐 **Full-Stack Engineering** – React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, FastAPI, Flask, Django
- 🔍 **AI for Real-World Use Cases** – NLP in healthcare, audio summarization, chatbot automation, research automation

## 🌱 Things I Love Exploring

- 🤖 AI agents and multi-agent collaboration (CrewAI, LangGraph)
- 🧬 Making LLMs trustworthy (evaluation, tracing, RAG tuning)
- 🧰 Building tools that empower other developers (tooling > templates!)
- 🎨 Frontend experiences that *don’t* look like they were made by AI

## 🧪 Featured Projects

- 🧠 **Multi-Agent Research Crew** – Automated article generation using GPT-4, Serper API & CrewAI. Each agent has a job. They collaborate. They write. You chill.
- 🎧 **Audio Summarization Platform** – Serverless NLP system built on AWS Lambda & Bedrock that summarizes customer calls. No more listening to hour-long recordings. Ever.
- 🦾 **LLM-powered Clinical Review Bot** – Used in healthcare to reduce 40% of manual documentation workload. Built with LangChain + FAISS + React.
